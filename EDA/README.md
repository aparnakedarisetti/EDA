Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to
 - maximize insight into a data set;
 - uncover underlying structure;
 - extract important variables;
 - detect outliers and anomalies;
 - test underlying assumptions;
 - develop parsimonious models; and
 - determine optimal factor settings.

EDA is executed majorly by -

 - Uni-variate visualization
 - Bi-variate visualization
 - Multivariate Visualization
 - Dimensionality reduction

We initially make several hypothesis by looking at the data before we hit the modelling. Tts quite a good practice cause that will engage you more with EDA part.

EDA helps you in confirming and validating the hypothesis you make. And from here you start your feature engineering part and take a flight to machine learning modelling.
